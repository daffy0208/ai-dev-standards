## Validation Before Building

### 🚨 CRITICAL: Always Validate Before Building

**Before making ANY technical decisions about frameworks, databases, or architecture:**

**Ask these questions FIRST:**

1. **Has the problem been validated?**
   - Have we talked to users?
   - Is this a real problem people will pay to solve?
   - What's our evidence?

2. **Has the solution been validated?**
   - Have we tested simpler alternatives?
   - Do users actually want this feature?
   - Can we validate with a cheaper approach first?

3. **Is building the right next step?**
   - Or should we validate assumptions first?
   - Can we test with manual processes?
   - What's the cheapest way to learn?

### Validation-First Decision Tree

```
User requests technical implementation (RAG, multi-agent, etc.)
│
├─ Has problem been validated?
│  ├─ No → Use product-strategist skill FIRST
│  │      → Validate problem (Mom Test interviews)
│  │      → Return to this tree after validation
│  │
│  └─ Yes → Continue to solution validation
│
├─ Has solution been validated?
│  ├─ No → Test cheaper alternatives FIRST
│  │      │
│  │      ├─ RAG? Try: FAQ page → Keyword search → Semantic search
│  │      ├─ Multi-agent? Try: Single agent → Manual coordination
│  │      ├─ Custom infra? Try: Managed platforms → PaaS → Self-hosted
│  │      │
│  │      → Return to this tree after testing
│  │
│  └─ Yes → Continue to technical decisions
│
└─ Proceed with technical implementation
   → Use appropriate decision framework sections below
```

### Cost Reality Checks

**Before implementing technical solutions, show users these alternatives:**

#### RAG Implementation

```
Before: RAG system (3-4 weeks, $200-500/month)
Try First:
1. FAQ page (1 day, $0)
2. Keyword search (2-3 days, $20/month)
3. Simple semantic search (1 week, $50/month)

Only proceed with RAG if simpler options tested and insufficient.
```

#### Multi-Agent System

```
Before: Multi-agent architecture (4-6 weeks, $300-800/month)
Try First:
1. Single agent with tools (1 week, $50/month)
2. Sequential processing (2 weeks, $100/month)

Only proceed with multi-agent if parallelization validated as necessary.
```

#### Custom Infrastructure

```
Before: Custom AWS setup (6-8 weeks, $500+/month)
Try First:
1. Vercel + Railway ($20/month)
2. PaaS solutions ($100/month)

Only proceed with custom if scale/requirements validated.
```

### Validation Phases & Time Limits

All projects should follow these phases with strict time limits:

#### Phase 1: Problem Discovery (2 weeks MAX)

- ⏰ **Time Limit:** 2 weeks
- 💰 **Budget:** $0 (user interviews only)
- ✅ **Exit Criteria:** 10+ interviews showing real problem

**If exceeds 2 weeks → STOP. Re-evaluate if problem is real.**

#### Phase 2: Solution Validation (3 days MAX)

- ⏰ **Time Limit:** 3 days
- 💰 **Budget:** $0-50 (prototypes/mockups)
- ✅ **Exit Criteria:** Users confirm they'd pay for solution

**If exceeds 3 days → STOP. Solution may be too complex.**

#### Phase 3: MVP Build (2 weeks MAX)

- ⏰ **Time Limit:** 2 weeks
- 💰 **Budget:** <$200
- ✅ **Exit Criteria:** Core value deliverable, testable

**If exceeds 2 weeks → STOP. Cut scope or validate assumptions.**

#### Phase 4: Validated Learning (Ongoing)

- 💰 **Budget:** <$1000/month
- ✅ **Metrics:** Track usage, retention, feedback
- 🎯 **Goal:** Prove product-market fit before scaling

#### Phase 5: Scale Decision

- Only proceed if Phase 4 metrics prove viability
- This is when expensive technical solutions are justified

### Warning Signs: Analysis Paralysis

**STOP if you see these patterns:**

- ❌ Research phase >2 weeks → Analysis paralysis
- ❌ Design phase >3 days → Over-engineering
- ❌ MVP >2 weeks → Scope creep
- ❌ No user testing → Building in vacuum
- ❌ Expensive tech before validation → Premature optimization

### Integration with Technical Decisions

**Only proceed to technical decision frameworks below if:**

1. ✅ Problem validated with users (Phase 1 complete)
2. ✅ Solution validated with cheap alternatives (Phase 2 complete)
3. ✅ MVP scope defined (Phase 3 ready)
4. ✅ Time and budget limits established

**Reference:** See [Validation-First Development Playbook](../playbooks/validation-first-development.md) for complete workflow.

## Architecture Patterns

### Single Agent vs Multi-Agent

**Single Agent:**

- Linear, sequential tasks
- One clear objective
- Minimal tool complexity
- Quick prototypes
- User interaction focused

**Decision criteria:** Can this be accomplished in one coherent workflow?

**Multi-Agent:**

- Complex, multi-step workflows
- Parallel processing beneficial
- Different specializations required
- Role-based task distribution
- Collaborative problem-solving

**Decision criteria:** Are there distinct specialized roles needed?

---

### RAG vs Fine-Tuning vs Prompt Engineering

**Prompt Engineering Only:**

- ✅ Task fits in context window
- ✅ No specialized knowledge needed
- ✅ One-time or ad-hoc queries
- ✅ Cost-sensitive
- ❌ Large knowledge bases
- ❌ Frequently updated information

**Use when:** Information is small enough to include in prompt.

**RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation):**

- ✅ Large knowledge base (1000+ documents)
- ✅ Frequently updated information
- ✅ Context-specific responses needed
- ✅ Need to cite sources
- ✅ Multiple data sources
- ✅ Want explainability
- ❌ Static knowledge
- ❌ Knowledge can fit in fine-tuning

**Use when:** Dynamic knowledge base that updates regularly.

**Fine-Tuning:**

- ✅ Specific style/format needed
- ✅ Behavior modification required
- ✅ Latency critical (no retrieval overhead)
- ✅ Cost of inference < cost of retrieval
- ✅ Static knowledge base
- ✅ Domain-specific language/terminology
- ❌ Frequently changing information
- ❌ Need source attribution

**Use when:** Knowledge is static and style/behavior customization critical.

**Decision Tree:**

```
Is information static or dynamic?
│
├─ Static
│  ├─ Fits in prompt? → Prompt Engineering
│  ├─ Need style customization? → Fine-Tuning
│  └─ Large knowledge base? → RAG (easier to update than retrain)
│
└─ Dynamic
   ├─ Fits in context? → Prompt Engineering
   └─ Too large for context? → RAG
```

---

### MCP vs Direct Integration

**Use MCP When:**

- ✅ Multiple clients need same data/tools
- ✅ Want standardized integration layer
- ✅ Building for Claude ecosystem
- ✅ Need to switch between AI providers
- ✅ Future-proofing important
- ✅ Team will build multiple AI applications
- ❌ One-off simple integration

**Use Direct Integration When:**

- ✅ Simple, one-time integration
- ✅ Performance critical (fewer abstraction layers)
- ✅ MCP adds unnecessary complexity
- ✅ Using APIs with existing SDKs
- ✅ Prototyping/MVP phase
- ❌ Will integrate with multiple AI systems

**Decision Tree:**

```
Will multiple applications use this tool/data?
│
├─ Yes → MCP (standardized, reusable)
│
└─ No
   ├─ Is this a reusable pattern? → Consider MCP (future-proof)
   ├─ Just prototyping? → Direct (faster)
   └─ Performance critical? → Direct (fewer layers)
```

├─ Yes
│  ├─ Scale < 1M vectors? → pgvector (start simple)
│  └─ Scale > 1M vectors? → Dedicated vector DB
│
└─ No
   ├─ Just prototyping? → Chroma (embedded, easy)
   │
   └─ Production system?
      ├─ Want managed? → Pinecone (easiest) or Weaviate Cloud
      │
      ├─ Need hybrid search? → Weaviate (built-in)
      │
      ├─ Performance critical? → Qdrant (fastest)
      │
      └─ Cost-sensitive? → Weaviate self-hosted or Qdrant
```

## Integration Approaches

### REST vs GraphQL

**REST:**

- ✅ Simple, well-understood
- ✅ Great caching (HTTP caching)
- ✅ Tooling everywhere
- ✅ Easier to version
- ❌ Over-fetching/under-fetching data
- ❌ Multiple requests for related data

**Use when:** Simple CRUD, public APIs, caching important, team knows REST.

**GraphQL:**

- ✅ Client controls data shape (no over-fetching)
- ✅ Single request for related data
- ✅ Strong typing
- ✅ Great for complex data requirements
- ❌ More complex to implement
- ❌ Caching more difficult
- ❌ Steeper learning curve

**Use when:** Complex data requirements, mobile apps (minimize requests), flexible client needs.

---

## Testing Strategy

### How Much to Test?

**Always Test:**

- Core business logic
- Security-critical code
- Public APIs
- Data transformations
- Payment processing
- Auth/authorization

**Can Skip Testing:**

- Quick prototypes (< 1 week lifespan)
- POCs not going to production
- Generated UI code (can be visually tested)
- Configuration files

**Test Distribution:**

**Production Application:**

- Unit tests: 70%
- Integration tests: 20%
- E2E tests: 10%
- Target coverage: >80%

**MVP/Prototype:**

- Critical path tests only
- Manual testing for UI
- No coverage targets

**Library/SDK:**

- Unit tests: 90%
- Integration tests: 10%
- Target coverage: >95%

---

## Example Decisions

### Example 1: Vector Database Selection

**Context:** RAG system for 100K documents, production use, need hybrid search

**Requirements:**

- Production-ready
- Hybrid search (semantic + keyword)
- Moderate budget
- Updates daily

**Options:**

1. Pinecone (managed, expensive)
2. Weaviate (hybrid search, moderate cost)
3. Chroma (cheap, but not production-scale)

**Decision:** Weaviate Cloud

**Reasoning:**

- Hybrid search built-in (requirement met)
- Managed service (production-ready)
- Better pricing than Pinecone
- Can self-host later if costs become issue
- Meets all requirements

**Trade-offs:**

- Smaller ecosystem than Pinecone
- Slightly more complex than Pinecone

**Re-evaluation triggers:**

- If costs exceed $X/month → consider self-hosting
- If scale exceeds 10M vectors → benchmark performance
- If Weaviate lacks critical feature → reconsider Pinecone

---

### Example 2: Framework Selection

**Context:** Building multi-agent code review system

**Requirements:**

- Specialized agent roles (syntax checker, security auditor, style enforcer)
- Coordination between agents
- Production system

**Options:**

1. LangGraph (complex but powerful)
2. CrewAI (role-based, simpler)
3. OpenAI Swarm (too simple for this)

**Decision:** CrewAI

**Reasoning:**

- Role-based collaboration matches use case perfectly
- Simpler than LangGraph (faster development)
- Production-ready
- Clear separation of concerns

**Trade-offs:**

- Less flexible than LangGraph for complex workflows
- Smaller community than LangChain

**Re-evaluation triggers:**

- If workflow becomes cyclical → consider LangGraph
- If need complex state management → consider LangGraph
