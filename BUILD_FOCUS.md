## 🛑 Current Freeze

Based on Dark Matter Mode analysis (RCI: 72/100 — MONITOR), the following activities are **FROZEN** until further notice:

### ❌ Frozen Activities

1. **New Skill Creation** — MORATORIUM
   - Current: 37 skills
   - Tools available: 7 MCPs
   - Ratio: 5.3:1 (improved from 12:1)
   - **Freeze until:** MCP count reaches 15+ (40% parity)

2. **New Documentation Files** — MORATORIUM
   - Current: 30 docs (16,302 lines)
   - Average: 543 lines per doc
   - Assessment: Documentation inflation
   - **Freeze until:** Consolidation to 15 docs complete

3. **New Analysis/Gap Docs** — MORATORIUM
   - We know the gaps. Time to build, not analyze.

## 📊 Success Metrics

### Build vs. Doc Ratio
- **Target:** ≥ 1.0 (every new doc = 1 feature completed)
- **Current baseline:** 0.1 (3 MCPs / 30 docs)
- **Weekly check:** Every Friday

### MCP Progress
- **Current:** 7/37 (19%) ✅ Ahead of schedule!
- **Original target:** 6/36 by Nov 11
- **Actual:** 7/37 by Oct 23 (3 weeks early)
- **Next milestone:** 10/37 (27%) by Nov 11

### Documentation Consolidation
- **Original:** 30 docs
- **Current:** 21 docs (30% reduction)
- **Target:** 15 docs (50% reduction)
- **Progress:** Well underway — archived 20 redundant files
- **Method:** Merge overlapping files, archive redundant analysis

## 🚫 What NOT to Do

1. **Don't create new skills** — Resist the urge to document new methodologies
2. **Don't write new gap analyses** — We have SKILL-MCP-GAP-ANALYSIS.md, ECOSYSTEM-PARITY-ANALYSIS.md, etc. That's enough.
3. **Don't mark things "COMPLETE"** — Use "STATUS" or "PROGRESS" instead
4. **Don't start 5 files in 9 minutes** — Focus on ONE thing deeply
5. **Don't plan MCP #7-30** — Build #4-6 first, then reassess

---

## ✅ What TO Do

1. **Build MCPs** — Code over docs
2. **Test MCPs** — Real integration tests, not just unit tests
3. **Document minimally** — README + usage examples, nothing more
4. **Consolidate existing docs** — Merge overlapping content
5. **Get external feedback** — Share MCPs with users early

---

## 📝 Completion Criteria (What "Done" Means)

For MCPs:
- [ ] Code written and tested
- [ ] Integration test with corresponding skill
- [ ] README with usage examples
- [ ] Registered in META/registry.json
- [ ] **Validated by at least one external user**

For Documentation Consolidation:
- [ ] Overlapping docs merged
- [ ] Redundant analysis archived to /DOCS/archive/
- [ ] 15 or fewer primary docs remain
- [ ] Each doc has clear, unique purpose

## 🎯 The Core Principle

> **"Trust follows execution, not documentation."**
> — Dark Matter Mode Report, 2025-10-22

The repository has exceptional self-awareness. It's time to channel that into **disciplined execution**.

Build. Ship. Iterate.

## 📅 Review Schedule

- **Weekly:** Friday MCP progress check
- **Bi-weekly:** Documentation consolidation status
- **Monthly:** Lift freeze if targets met, reassess priorities

## 🧭 Guiding Questions

Before starting any new work, ask:

1. **Is this building an MCP?** → YES: Proceed | NO: Defer
2. **Is this consolidating docs?** → YES: Proceed | NO: Defer
3. **Is this new documentation?** → STOP (freeze active)
4. **Is this a new skill?** → STOP (freeze active)
5. **Is this analysis of gaps?** → We know the gaps. Build instead.

**Status:** Under construction is better than over-documented.

**Motto:** Incomplete and building > Complete and stagnant

**Next Review:** 2025-11-22 (after 3 MCPs built)
