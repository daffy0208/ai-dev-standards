## Integration with mvp-builder Skill

### How This MCP Enables mvp-builder

The feature-prioritizer-mcp provides **feature prioritization** implementation for mvp-builder:

1. **P0/P1/P2 Classification** - Categorize features by priority (mvp-builder SKILL.md:23-25)
2. **Impact-Effort Matrix** - Identify quick wins (high impact, low effort)
3. **RICE Scoring** - Data-driven prioritization alternative
4. **MVP Scope Definition** - Get P0 + top 3 P1 features automatically
5. **Time Estimation** - Estimate effort based on priority levels

### mvp-builder Workflow Integration Points

```
mvp-builder workflow → feature-prioritizer-mcp tools
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. Brainstorm features    → add_feature (capture backlog)
2. Categorize P0/P1/P2    → prioritize_features (classify)
3. Define MVP scope       → get_mvp_features (P0 + top P1)
4. Calculate RICE         → calculate_rice_score (validation)
5. Build P0 only          → Use P0 list from prioritization
6. Validate before P1     → Re-prioritize after validation
```

### mvp-builder Usage Example

**From mvp-builder SKILL.md:266-267:**
```
- [ ] Categorize features (P0/P1/P2/Out of Scope)
- [ ] Build P0 only (1-2 weeks max)
```

**Using feature-prioritizer-mcp:**
```
1. Add all brainstormed features via add_feature
2. Run prioritize_features to get P0/P1/P2/P3 classification
3. Run get_mvp_features to get MVP scope (P0 + top P1)
4. Build only P0 features (1-2 weeks)
5. Validate with users
6. Decide: build P1 or pivot
```

## Test Results Summary

| Test Step | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Add feature | ✅ PASS | All fields captured correctly |
| Impact-Effort prioritization | ✅ PASS | P0/P1/P2/P3 classification accurate |
| RICE scoring | ✅ PASS | Formula: (R × I × C) / E |
| Get MVP features | ✅ PASS | Returns P0 + top 3 P1 |
| List features | ✅ PASS | Returns all features with metadata |
| Clear features | ✅ PASS | Cleanup successful |

## Validation

- ✅ All 6 MCP tools functional
- ✅ Supports 2 prioritization methodologies (Impact-Effort, RICE)
- ✅ P0/P1/P2/P3 classification matches mvp-builder framework
- ✅ MVP feature selection follows "P0 + top 3 P1" rule
- ✅ Time estimation based on effort scores
- ✅ Error handling validated
- ✅ Registered in META/registry.json
- ✅ 18/18 unit tests passing
- ✅ Enables mvp-builder skill per registry

## External Validation

**Status**: Pending - Requires user to test with real product features

**Next Steps**:
1. User adds real product features to backlog
2. User runs prioritization with Impact-Effort matrix
3. User compares with RICE scoring methodology
4. User validates P0/P1/P2 classifications match business priorities
5. User builds MVP using P0 features only
6. User reports prioritization accuracy and usefulness

## Conclusion

✅ **Integration Test PASSED**

The feature-prioritizer-mcp successfully provides all required tools for mvp-builder skill's feature prioritization workflow. The MCP implements both Impact-Effort matrix and RICE scoring methodologies, giving users flexibility in how they prioritize features for MVP development.

**Impact**: This MCP enables data-driven MVP scoping, helping users avoid over-engineering and focus on building P0 features first (as per mvp-builder's core philosophy).
