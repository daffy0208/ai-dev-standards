## üéØ Test Project: "FeedbackHub" - Customer Feedback SaaS

Let's pretend you're building a customer feedback management tool for small businesses.

### Step 1: Create Test Project

```bash
# Create a test project directory
mkdir ~/test-feedbackhub
cd ~/test-feedbackhub

# Initialize git (optional)
git init
```

### Step 2: Add This Exact .cursorrules

Copy this **exactly** into `.cursorrules`:

```markdown
# Project: FeedbackHub - Customer Feedback Management SaaS

## AI Development Standards
Repository: ~/ai-dev-standards/
Status: Active

### Instructions for Claude Code

**ALWAYS start by loading:**
1. ~/ai-dev-standards/META/PROJECT-CONTEXT.md
2. ~/ai-dev-standards/META/HOW-TO-USE.md
3. ~/ai-dev-standards/META/DECISION-FRAMEWORK.md

**Check skill registry:**
~/ai-dev-standards/META/skill-registry.json

### Primary Skills for This Project
- mvp-builder (feature prioritization)
- product-strategist (market validation)
- frontend-builder (Next.js development)
- api-designer (REST API design)
- deployment-advisor (infrastructure)
- go-to-market-planner (launch prep)

---

## What We're Building

**FeedbackHub** - A simple SaaS tool for small businesses (restaurants, retail stores, salons) to collect and manage customer feedback.

### Target Customer
- Small businesses (1-10 employees)
- Non-technical owners (restaurant owners, salon owners, etc.)
- Currently using: paper forms, Google Forms, or nothing
- Budget: $10-30/month

### The Problem
Small businesses want customer feedback but:
- Paper forms get lost
- Google Forms responses scattered in email
- No way to track trends or take action
- Too busy to analyze feedback manually

### Our Solution (Hypothesis)
A simple dashboard that:
- Generates custom feedback forms (QR code or link)
- Collects responses in one place
- Shows trends (ratings over time, common complaints)
- Sends weekly summary email

---

## Current Phase: Week 2 of MVP Development

- [x] Week 1: Problem validation (interviewed 10 restaurant owners)
- [x] Week 2: MVP scope definition ‚Üê **WE ARE HERE**
- [ ] Weeks 3-6: Build core features
- [ ] Week 7: Beta test with 5 businesses
- [ ] Week 8: Iterate based on feedback
- [ ] Week 9-10: Polish and bug fixes
- [ ] Week 11-12: Prepare for launch

---

## Riskiest Assumptions to Validate

1. **Will businesses actually share the QR code/link with customers?**
   - Risk: High - If they don't share it, we have no product
   - Validation: Beta test, track how many QR codes are displayed

2. **Do businesses care about trends or just raw feedback?**
   - Risk: Medium - Affects if we build analytics
   - Validation: Show both options to 5 test businesses

3. **Will they pay $20/month for this?**
   - Risk: High - Business model validation
   - Validation: Ask during beta, show pricing page

---

## MVP Scope: P0/P1/P2 Features

### P0 - Must Have (Launch Blockers)
- [ ] Business owner signup/login
- [ ] Create feedback form (3 fields: rating, comment, contact)
- [ ] Generate QR code for form
- [ ] Customer submits feedback (no login required)
- [ ] Dashboard showing list of feedback
- [ ] Basic filtering (by date, rating)
- [ ] Weekly email summary (feedback count, avg rating)

### P1 - Should Have (Post-MVP v1.1)
- [ ] Multiple locations support (for chains)
- [ ] Custom branding (logo, colors on form)
- [ ] Trend charts (ratings over time)
- [ ] Email notifications for negative feedback
- [ ] Export to CSV
- [ ] Integration with email (send feedback via email)

### P2 - Nice to Have (Future)
- [ ] AI-powered insights ("Common complaint: slow service")
- [ ] Mobile app for business owners
- [ ] SMS notifications
- [ ] Integration with POS systems
- [ ] Multi-language forms

---

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- Next.js 14 (App Router)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- shadcn/ui components
- React Hook Form + Zod validation

### Backend
- Next.js API Routes
- Prisma ORM
- PostgreSQL database

### Services
- Auth: NextAuth.js with email magic links
- Email: Resend (transactional emails)
- QR Codes: `qrcode` npm package
- Hosting: Vercel (free tier for now)
- Database: Railway (free tier for now)

### Why This Stack?
- Next.js: Fastest path to MVP, handles frontend + API
- PostgreSQL: Relational data (businesses, forms, feedback)
- Vercel: Zero config deployment
- Free tier: Total cost: $0 until we validate

---

## Database Schema (Draft)

```prisma
model Business {
  id        String   @id @default(uuid())
  email     String   @unique
  name      String
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  forms     Form[]
}

model Form {
  id          String     @id @default(uuid())
  businessId  String
  business    Business   @relation(fields: [businessId], references: [id])
  title       String     @default("Customer Feedback")
  qrCodeUrl   String
  createdAt   DateTime   @default(now())
  feedback    Feedback[]
}

model Feedback {
  id          String   @id @default(uuid())
  formId      String
  form        Form     @relation(fields: [formId], references: [id])
  rating      Int      // 1-5 stars
  comment     String?
  customerEmail String?
  createdAt   DateTime @default(now())
}
```

## Code Conventions

### File Structure
```
/app
  /(auth)
    /login
    /signup
  /dashboard
    /page.tsx          # Feedback list
    /form-setup        # QR code display
  /f/[formId]          # Public feedback form
  /api

/lib
  /db.ts              # Prisma client
  /email.ts           # Email utilities
/prisma
  /schema.prisma
```

### Naming Conventions
- Components: PascalCase (`FeedbackList.tsx`)
- API routes: kebab-case (`/api/feedback/submit`)
- Database: snake_case (Prisma default)

---

## Security & Quality

### P0 Security
- [x] Magic link auth (no password to leak)
- [x] Business owners can only see their own feedback
- [x] Public forms don't require auth (intentional)
- [x] Rate limiting on feedback submission (prevent spam)
- [x] Input validation (Zod on all forms)

### Performance Targets
- Dashboard load: <2s
- Public form submit: <1s
- Email delivery: <5 minutes

---

## Instructions for Claude

When I ask you questions about this project:

### For Feature Decisions
‚Üí Use **mvp-builder** skill
‚Üí Apply P0/P1/P2 matrix
‚Üí Validate against riskiest assumptions

### For Architecture
‚Üí Consult **DECISION-FRAMEWORK.md**
‚Üí Explain trade-offs (simplicity vs features)
‚Üí Recommend based on MVP phase

### For Code
‚Üí Follow **frontend-builder** or **api-designer** skills
‚Üí Match tech stack above (Next.js, Prisma)
‚Üí Keep it simple (we're in MVP phase)

### For Launch Planning
‚Üí Use **go-to-market-planner** skill
‚Üí Reference timeline (weeks 9-12)
‚Üí Focus on validation, not scale
```

### Step 3: Open in Claude Code

```bash
# Open project in Cursor/Claude Code
cursor ~/test-feedbackhub

# Or if using VS Code with Claude
code ~/test-feedbackhub
```

## üß™ Now Test These Conversations

### Test 1: Feature Prioritization

**You ask:**
```
"A user requested we add SMS notifications for negative feedback. Should we build this?"
```

**Claude should:**
1. Load mvp-builder skill
2. Check P0/P1/P2 list (it's P2)
3. Evaluate against riskiest assumptions
4. Recommend: "No - focus on P0 features first"
5. Explain why: Not validating core assumptions

---

### Test 2: Architecture Decision

**You ask:**
```
"Should I use PostgreSQL or MongoDB for this project?"
```

**Claude should:**
1. Consult DECISION-FRAMEWORK.md
2. Review your data (Business, Form, Feedback - relational!)
3. Recommend PostgreSQL
4. Explain: Relational data, strong consistency needed
5. Note: Already in your tech stack ‚úì

---

### Test 3: MVP Validation

**You ask:**
```
"Is my P0 feature list too big? Can I cut anything?"
```

**Claude should:**
1. Use mvp-builder skill
2. Review your riskiest assumptions
3. Check each P0 feature against assumptions
4. Recommend cuts (likely: "Weekly email summary" ‚Üí Move to P1)
5. Explain: Email summary doesn't validate core assumptions

---

### Test 4: Code Implementation

**You ask:**
```
"Write the API route for submitting feedback"
```

**Claude should:**
1. Use api-designer skill
2. Follow your tech stack (Next.js API route, Prisma)
3. Include validation (Zod)
4. Add error handling
5. Include rate limiting (you listed it as P0 security)
6. Provide complete, production-ready code

---

### Test 5: Launch Planning

**You ask:**
```
"I'm in week 8, should I delay launch to add trend charts?"
```

**Claude should:**
1. Use mvp-builder OR go-to-market-planner
2. Check: Trend charts are P1 (not P0)
3. Check: You're testing assumption #2 (do businesses care about trends?)
4. Recommend: Ship P0, add trends in v1.1 if beta users want them
5. Remind: "Perfect is the enemy of shipped"

---

## ‚úÖ Expected Results
