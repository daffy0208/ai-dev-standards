## Then Ask Claude

After setup, you'll see recommendations like:

```
Recommended Skills:
  • mvp-builder - For rapid development
  • testing-strategist - Set up tests
  • frontend-builder - Structure your app
```

Then just ask Claude:

```
"Use mvp-builder to help me start this project.
The analysis recommended focusing on [the priority tasks shown]."
```

Claude will know exactly what to do.

## Troubleshooting

**"bash: setup-project.sh: command not found"**

First time? Clone ai-dev-standards:
```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/daffy0208/ai-dev-standards.git
cd /your/project
bash ~/ai-dev-standards/setup-project.sh
```

**"Command not found: ai-dev"**

The script installs it automatically. If it fails:
```bash
cd ~/ai-dev-standards/CLI
npm install
npm link
```

## That's It

One command.

Everything set up.

No configuration needed. The tool figures it all out.
