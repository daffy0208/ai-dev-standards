# MVP Builder

Ship MVPs in 1-2 weeks, not months.

## Core Principle

**Start with the smallest thing that proves/disproves your riskiest assumption.**

MVP = Minimum **Viable** Product, not Minimum **Pretty** Product.

## MVP Feature Matrix

Categorize every feature idea using this matrix:

| Category | Definition | Action |
|----------|------------|--------|
| **P0** | Must have for core value proposition | Build now |
| **P1** | Important but can wait for v1.1 | Ship after validation |
| **P2** | Nice to have, delight features | Ship v2+ |
| **Out of Scope** | Not needed for validation | Defer indefinitely |

### Example: Task Management MVP

**P0 (Week 1):**
- Create task with title/description
- Mark task complete
- View task list
- Basic authentication

**P1 (Post-validation):**
- Due dates, priorities, reminders

**P2 (Future):**
- Team collaboration, file attachments, mobile app

**Out of Scope:**
- Gantt charts, time tracking, integrations

## 5 MVP Patterns

### 1. Concierge MVP
**Definition:** Manually deliver the service before building automation

**When to use:** Core value is service delivery, not technology

**Examples:**
- Food delivery → Take orders via WhatsApp, deliver yourself
- AI copywriter → Manually write copy for customers
- Scheduling tool → Coordinate meetings via email

**Time:** 1-3 days | **Validates:** People want the service

---

### 2. Wizard of Oz MVP
**Definition:** Interface looks automated, but humans operate it behind the scenes

**When to use:** Automation is expensive/complex to build

**Examples:**
- Zapier early days → Manually created integrations
- AI chatbot → Human answers, customer thinks it's AI

**Time:** 1 week | **Validates:** Users engage with interface

---

### 3. Landing Page MVP
**Definition:** Explain the product + collect emails (no product yet)

**When to use:** Testing demand before building anything

**Examples:**
- Dropbox → Video showing concept
- Buffer → Landing page before code existed

**Time:** 1-2 days | **Validates:** People sign up for waitlist

---

### 4. Single-Feature MVP
**Definition:** One feature that solves one problem

**When to use:** One feature delivers 80% of value

**Examples:**
- Twitter → Just post 140-character updates
- Instagram → Just share photos with filters
- Stripe → Just accept credit card payments

**Time:** 1-2 weeks | **Validates:** People use the core feature

---

### 5. Piecemeal MVP
**Definition:** Combine existing tools instead of building custom

**When to use:** You can cobble together a solution with existing tools

**Examples:**
- Typeform + Airtable + Zapier + Stripe
- No-code tools: Webflow, Bubble, Retool

**Time:** 2-5 days | **Validates:** Workflow works end-to-end

## Tech Stack Decision Tree

```
Is this a web app?
├─ YES
│  ├─ Need real-time?
│  │  ├─ YES → Next.js + Supabase + WebSockets
│  │  └─ NO → Remix + PostgreSQL
│  └─ Simple CRUD? → Supabase + React
└─ NO
   ├─ Mobile app? → React Native + Expo
   ├─ API only? → Express + PostgreSQL
   ├─ Chrome extension? → Vanilla JS + Chrome APIs
   └─ CLI tool? → Node.js or Python
```

**Recommended MVP Stack:**
- **Frontend:** React + Vite or Next.js
- **Backend:** Supabase (Postgres + Auth + Storage) or Express.js
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
- **Hosting:** Vercel/Netlify (frontend) + Railway/Fly.io (backend)
- **Auth:** Clerk or Supabase Auth
- **Payments:** Stripe Checkout

**Speed-Focused Tools:**
- Supabase (backend in 10 min)
- Vercel v0 (UI generation)
- Clerk (auth in 5 min)
- Stripe Checkout (payments in 20 min)

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

❌ **Building features "just in case"** → Build when 3+ users request
❌ **Perfect design before launch** → Ship functional, ugly is fine
❌ **Over-engineering architecture** → Monolith is fine for MVP
❌ **Custom authentication** → Use Clerk, Auth0, or Supabase Auth
❌ **Building admin panel first** → Use database GUI (Retool/Supabase)
❌ **Mobile app before web** → Web first, always
❌ **Scaling for 1M users** → Build for 10 users, scale when needed

## MVP Quality Standards

### Must Have ✅
- Core feature works end-to-end
- Basic auth (login/signup)
- Deploys without crashing
- Mobile-responsive (doesn't need to be beautiful)
- Basic error handling

### Can Skip ⏸️
- Perfect UI/UX
- Email notifications
- Advanced features
- Analytics dashboard
- Error monitoring (add after validation)
- Tests (add after product-market fit)

## Build Process

### Week 1: Build Core Feature
**Days 1-2: Design + Setup**
- Sketch 3 screens (paper/Figma)
- Set up repo + database (3-5 tables max)
- Deploy infrastructure

**Days 3-4: Build**
- Authentication (use library, don't build)
- Core feature (1 user flow only)
- Basic UI (use component library)

**Day 5: Polish + Deploy**
- Fix critical bugs
- Deploy to production
- Share with 5 friends for feedback

### Week 2: Validate
**Days 1-2: Iterate**
- Fix issues from Week 1 feedback
- Add 1-2 critical missing features

**Days 3-4: Get Users**
- Share on social media
- Post in relevant communities
- Email 20 people personally

**Day 5: Analyze & Decide**
- Did 10+ people sign up?
- Did 3+ people use it 3+ times?
- Are 1-2 people willing to pay?

**Decision Point:**
- ✅ Yes to above → Build P1 features
- ❌ No → Pivot or kill project

## Launch Checklist

**Pre-Launch (1 hour):**
- [ ] Core user flow works end-to-end
- [ ] Sign up + login works
- [ ] Deployed with HTTPS
- [ ] Privacy policy + ToS (use generator)

**Launch Day:**
- [ ] Post on Twitter/LinkedIn with screenshot
- [ ] Share in 3-5 relevant communities
- [ ] Email 20 people personally

**Week 1 Post-Launch:**
- [ ] Reply to every piece of feedback
- [ ] Fix critical bugs within 24 hours
- [ ] User interview with 3-5 early users

## Success Metrics

**MVP validation criteria:**
- **10+ signups** in first week
- **3+ people** use it 3+ times
- **1-2 people** willing to pay

**If you hit these:** You might have something. Build P1 features.

**If you don't:** Pivot or move on. Don't invest months in something nobody wants.

## Real MVP Examples

**Successful minimal starts:**
- **Airbnb:** Photos of their apartment + PayPal link
- **Stripe:** Just a form to collect card details
- **Dropbox:** Video demo before building product
- **Uber:** iPhone app in San Francisco only
- **Facebook:** Harvard students only, basic profiles

All started much smaller than you think.
