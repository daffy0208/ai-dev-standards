# MVP Builder - Quick Start

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Category:** Product Development
**Difficulty:** Beginner

## What This Skill Does

Helps you build and launch MVPs in 1-2 weeks by prioritizing ruthlessly and choosing the right MVP pattern.

## When to Use

Use this skill when you need to:
- Prioritize features for an MVP
- Decide what to build vs defer
- Choose the fastest path to validation
- Avoid over-engineering
- Ship products fast

## Quick Start

**Fastest path to an MVP:**

1. Identify your riskiest assumption
2. Choose an MVP pattern:
   - **Concierge:** Manual service delivery
   - **Wizard of Oz:** Fake automation, manual backend
   - **Landing Page:** Email capture before building
   - **Single-Feature:** One feature only
   - **Piecemeal:** Combine existing tools
3. Categorize features as P0/P1/P2/Out of Scope
4. Build P0 only (1-2 weeks)
5. Validate with 10+ users

**Time to value:** 1-2 weeks

## Prerequisites

**Knowledge:**
- Basic product development understanding

**Tools:**
- None required (skill helps choose tools)

**Related Skills:**
- None required (good starting point)

## Success Criteria

You've successfully used this skill when:
- ✅ Features categorized as P0/P1/P2
- ✅ MVP pattern chosen with clear reasoning
- ✅ P0 features built in 1-2 weeks
- ✅ Product shipped to real users
- ✅ Validation metrics tracked

## Common Workflows

### Workflow 1: New Product Idea
1. Use mvp-builder to prioritize features
2. Build P0 features only
3. Use `deployment-advisor` to deploy
4. Use `go-to-market-planner` to launch

### Workflow 2: Feature Prioritization
1. Use mvp-builder P0/P1/P2 matrix
2. Build P0 features
3. Validate before building P1

## Key Concepts

**P0 vs P1 vs P2:**
- P0 = Must have for core value prop (build now)
- P1 = Important but can wait (ship v1.1)
- P2 = Nice to have (ship v2+)

**5 MVP Patterns:**
1. Concierge (manual service)
2. Wizard of Oz (fake automation)
3. Landing Page (email capture)
4. Single-Feature (one feature only)
5. Piecemeal (combine existing tools)

## Troubleshooting

**Skill not activating?**
- Try explicitly requesting: "Use the mvp-builder skill to..."
- Mention keywords: "MVP", "prioritization", "features"

**Too many features in P0?**
- Reassess: Does it prove/disprove your riskiest assumption?
- If no, move to P1

**Can't decide on MVP pattern?**
- Default to Single-Feature MVP (most common)
- Or Landing Page MVP (fastest validation)
