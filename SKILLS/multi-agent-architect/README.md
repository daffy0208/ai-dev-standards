# Multi-Agent Architect - Quick Start

**Version:** 1.0.0 | **Category:** AI-Native Development | **Difficulty:** Advanced

## What This Skill Does
Design and orchestrate multi-agent systems where specialized agents collaborate to solve complex tasks through clear communication patterns and coordination strategies.

## Quick Start
1. **Choose pattern** - Sequential, Hierarchical, Peer, or Swarm
2. **Define agents** - Clear roles and responsibilities (2-5 agents)
3. **Communication** - Shared memory, message passing, or events
4. **Implement** - CrewAI (role-based) or LangGraph (state machines)
5. **Monitor** - Track execution, costs, failures

## Success Criteria
- ✅ Agents have clear, non-overlapping responsibilities
- ✅ Communication pattern chosen and implemented
- ✅ Workflow handles agent failures gracefully
- ✅ Execution traced and logged
- ✅ Cost per workflow tracked

## Key Patterns
- **Sequential**: A → B → C → D (clear dependencies)
- **Hierarchical**: Manager → Workers (parallel subtasks)
- **Peer**: Collaboration with review (quality through iteration)
- **Swarm**: Explore solutions, pick best

## Decision: Single vs Multi-Agent
- Single: Task is simple, linear, single expertise
- Multi: Requires specialization, parallelization, or review
