# Task Breakdown Specialist

**Lower activation energy. Build momentum. Make progress visible.**

## Core Principle

ADHD brains struggle with large, ambiguous tasks due to high activation energy. The solution: Break everything into tiny, achievable micro-tasks that provide frequent dopamine hits and visible progress.

**Key Insight:** Starting is the hardest part. Make starting ridiculously easy.

---

## The ADHD Task Problem

### Problem 1: Activation Energy
**Issue:** "Build authentication system" feels overwhelming
**Result:** Procrastination, anxiety, avoidance

### Problem 2: Time Blindness
**Issue:** Can't estimate how long tasks take
**Result:** Unrealistic plans, missed deadlines, frustration

### Problem 3: Working Memory
**Issue:** Can't hold large task in mind while working
**Result:** Losing track of what you're doing, constant re-reading

### Problem 4: Dopamine Deficit
**Issue:** Big tasks provide no intermediate rewards
**Result:** Motivation loss, task abandonment

---

## Phase 1: Quick Win Strategy

### Start with 2-Minute Tasks

**Why:** Zero activation energy, instant dopamine, builds momentum

```markdown
❌ Bad Task: "Build user authentication"
  - Feels huge (overwhelm)
  - Unclear start point (paralysis)
  - No quick wins (no dopamine)

✅ Good Breakdown:

Quick Wins (Build Momentum) ⚡
1. [ ] Create /auth folder (30 sec) 🟢
2. [ ] Create auth.ts file (30 sec) 🟢
3. [ ] Install bcrypt package (1 min) 🟢

WHY START HERE:
- Combined: 2 minutes total
- Zero thinking required
- 3 quick dopamine hits
- Momentum established

THEN move to real work...
```

### The 2-5-15-30 Pattern

Break tasks into time categories:

**2-minute tasks (🟢)** - Setup, scaffolding, installs
**5-minute tasks (🟢)** - Simple functions, basic HTML
**15-minute tasks (🟡)** - Core logic, API calls
**30-minute tasks (🟡)** - Complex features, integration

**Rule:** Always start with 2-minute tasks!

---

## Phase 2: The Breakdown Formula

### Step 1: Capture the Big Task

Write down the overwhelming task:

```markdown
Big Task: Build user dashboard with analytics
```

### Step 2: Ask Clarifying Questions

```markdown
Questions:
- What's the absolute minimum? (MVP)
- What would "done" look like?
- What can I skip for now?
- What's P0 vs P1 vs P2?
```

### Step 3: Identify Micro-Tasks

Use this template:

```markdown
## Big Task: Build User Dashboard

### P0 (Must Have - MVP)
- Dashboard page exists
- Shows user name
- Shows one metric (login count)

### P1 (Should Have - Next)
- Charts and graphs
- Multiple metrics
- Time range selector

### P2 (Nice to Have - Later)
- Export data
- Custom widgets
- Real-time updates
```

### Step 4: Break P0 into Micro-Tasks

```markdown
## Building P0 Dashboard

Phase 1: Quick Wins (Momentum) ⚡
1. [ ] Create dashboard.tsx file (30 sec) 🟢
2. [ ] Add to navigation menu (1 min) 🟢
3. [ ] Add "Dashboard" heading (30 sec) 🟢
   Total: 2 minutes

Phase 2: Core Structure 🏗️
4. [ ] Create dashboard layout (5 min) 🟢
5. [ ] Add user name display (5 min) 🟢
6. [ ] Style with Tailwind (10 min) 🟡
   Total: 20 minutes

Phase 3: Data Integration 📊
7. [ ] Fetch user data from API (15 min) 🟡
8. [ ] Display login count (10 min) 🟡
9. [ ] Add loading state (5 min) 🟢
   Total: 30 minutes

Phase 4: Polish & Ship ✨
10. [ ] Handle error states (10 min) 🟡
11. [ ] Test all paths (10 min) 🟡
12. [ ] Deploy (5 min) 🟢
    Total: 25 minutes

Grand Total: ~75 minutes
With ADHD tax (1.5x): ~110 minutes (2 hours)
```

## Phase 3: Task Sizing with ADHD Tax

### Standard Time Estimates Are Lies

Neurotypical estimate × 1.5-2 = ADHD estimate

**Why:**
- Task switching overhead
- Distraction recovery time
- Setup/teardown time
- "Where was I?" moments
- Inevitable rabbit holes

### ADHD Time Multipliers

```markdown
Simple task (5 min estimated):
  → ADHD reality: 7-10 min (1.5x)

Medium task (30 min estimated):
  → ADHD reality: 45-60 min (1.5-2x)

Complex task (2 hours estimated):
  → ADHD reality: 3-4 hours (2x)

New/Unknown task (?? estimated):
  → ADHD reality: 3x whatever you think
```

### Honest Task Sizing

```markdown
## Feature: Add password reset

Traditional estimate: 1 hour

ADHD-honest estimate:
- Setup email service (5 min → 10 min)
- Generate reset token (10 min → 15 min)
- Build reset form (20 min → 30 min)
- Handle token validation (15 min → 25 min)
- Test flows (10 min → 20 min)

Subtotal: 60 min → 100 min
+ Buffer for interruptions: +20 min
+ Debugging time: +30 min

Real estimate: 2.5 hours

👍 Better to overestimate and finish early (dopamine!)
👎 Than underestimate and feel like failure
```

## Phase 4: Momentum-Based Ordering

### Dopamine-Optimized Task Sequence

**Don't do tasks in logical order. Do them in motivation order.**

```markdown
❌ Logical Order (ADHD-hostile):
1. Plan architecture (hard, no dopamine)
2. Set up database (boring, no dopamine)
3. Build API (complex, delayed dopamine)
4. Build UI (fun but blocked by above)

✅ Momentum Order (ADHD-friendly):
1. Build UI mockup (fun, instant visual) 🎨 Dopamine!
2. Add fake data (easy, looks real) 🎯 Dopamine!
3. Hook up API (has context now) 💪 Dopamine!
4. Set up database (motivated now) ✅ Dopamine!
5. Refine architecture (understand it now) 🚀 Done!

Why this works:
- Starts with fun (low activation energy)
- Provides instant feedback (dopamine)
- Builds understanding (easier to do hard parts)
- Maintains momentum (no dead zones)
```

### The Quick Win Sandwich

**Pattern:** Easy → Hard → Easy

```markdown
Session Plan (2 hours):

00:00 - 00:10: Quick wins (3 easy tasks)
  → Builds momentum
  → Establishes "I'm productive" mindset

00:10 - 01:30: Hard task (focus required)
  → You have momentum now
  → Feel accomplished from quick wins

01:30 - 02:00: Easy task (cool down)
  → End on high note
  → Easy to resume tomorrow
```

## Phase 5: Progress Visualization

### Make Progress Visible

ADHD brains need to SEE progress for dopamine release.

Day 1: Phase 1 + 2 (1.5 hours)
Day 2: Phase 3 (2 hours)
```

---

## Phase 7: Anti-Patterns (What NOT to Do)

### ❌ Anti-Pattern 1: Perfectionist Breakdown

```markdown
Bad:
- [ ] Research best authentication library (no time limit)
- [ ] Compare 10 different approaches (rabbit hole)
- [ ] Design perfect architecture (never starts)

Good:
- [ ] Choose auth library (10 min, use NextAuth)
- [ ] Follow quickstart guide (30 min)
- [ ] Ship MVP, iterate later
```

### ❌ Anti-Pattern 2: Too Granular

```markdown
Bad:
- [ ] Open VS Code (10 sec)
- [ ] Navigate to file (10 sec)
- [ ] Type 'import' (5 sec)

This is ridiculous. You'll spend more time reading the list.

Good:
- [ ] Add imports to auth.ts (2 min)
```

### ❌ Anti-Pattern 3: All Hard Tasks

```markdown
Bad:
- [ ] Refactor authentication (2 hours)
- [ ] Optimize database queries (3 hours)
- [ ] Fix critical bug (2 hours)

No quick wins = No momentum = No dopamine = Procrastination

Good:
- [ ] Update README (5 min) 🟢 ← Start here!
- [ ] Refactor one function (30 min) 🟡
- [ ] Take break (5 min)
- [ ] Fix critical bug (2 hours) 🟡
```

### ❌ Anti-Pattern 4: Vague Tasks

```markdown
Bad:
- [ ] Work on dashboard
- [ ] Fix bugs
- [ ] Improve performance

What does "done" mean? ADHD brain will wander.

Good:
- [ ] Add user stats to dashboard (15 min)
- [ ] Fix login timeout bug (#123) (20 min)
- [ ] Reduce API response time to < 200ms (1 hour)
```

## Phase 8: Emergency Task Breakdown

### When You're Stuck RIGHT NOW

**5-Minute Breakdown Exercise:**

1. **Write the overwhelming task:**
   ```
   _________________________________
   ```

2. **What's the FIRST tiny action?** (< 2 min)
   ```
   _________________________________
   ```

3. **Do ONLY that action. Nothing else.**

4. **Dopamine hit! Now write next action:**
   ```
   _________________________________
   ```

5. **Repeat.**

**Example:**
```
1. Overwhelming: "Build entire checkout flow"
2. First tiny action: "Create checkout.tsx file"
3. [DO IT NOW - 30 seconds]
4. ✅ Done! Dopamine!
5. Next action: "Add basic form HTML"
6. [DO IT - 5 min]
7. Keep going...
```

- [ ] Uses progress visualization (%, bars, checklists)
- [ ] Easy tasks mixed with hard tasks (momentum maintenance)
- [ ] No vague tasks ("work on", "improve", "fix")
- [ ] Total time estimated honestly (not wishful thinking)
- [ ] First task has near-zero activation energy
