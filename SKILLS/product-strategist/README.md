# Product Strategist - Quick Start

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Category:** Product Development
**Difficulty:** Intermediate

## What This Skill Does

Systematically validates product ideas before development by testing problem severity, solution viability, market size, and business model economics.

## When to Use

Use this skill when you need to:
- Validate a new product idea before building
- Assess problem-solution fit
- Define MVP scope and prioritize features
- Make build-vs-buy decisions
- Avoid building products nobody wants

## Quick Start

**Fastest path to validation:**

1. **Validate the problem** (Phase 1)
   - Interview 10-15 potential customers
   - Use "Mom Test" questions (ask about behavior, not opinions)
   - Score problem severity matrix
   - Require 4-5 "High" scores to proceed

2. **Test the solution** (Phase 2)
   - Create smoke test (landing page + email capture)
   - Build low-fidelity prototype
   - Test with 10-15 users
   - Require >50% to say they'd pay

3. **Size the market** (Phase 3)
   - Calculate TAM, SAM, SOM
   - Require SOM ≥ $1M with >10% growth
   - Analyze 3-5 competitors
   - Define your 10x advantage

4. **Validate economics** (Phase 4)
   - Estimate LTV and CAC
   - Require LTV:CAC ≥ 3:1
   - Test pricing with Van Westendorp method

5. **Define MVP** (Phase 5)
   - List must-have features only
   - Scope to 4-8 weeks
   - Define success metrics
   - Get stakeholder approval

**Time to decision:** 2-4 weeks for comprehensive validation

## Prerequisites

**Knowledge:**
- Basic product development understanding
- Customer interview skills (or willingness to learn)

**Tools:**
- None required (skill guides validation process)

**Related Skills:**
- None required (good starting point)

## Success Criteria

You've successfully used this skill when:
- ✅ All 5 validation phases completed with gates checked
- ✅ Problem validated: 70%+ of interviewees confirm severity
- ✅ Solution validated: 50%+ of testers would pay
- ✅ Market validated: SOM ≥ $1M with >10% growth
- ✅ Economics validated: LTV:CAC ≥ 3:1 achievable
- ✅ MVP defined: Scoped to 4-8 weeks with clear metrics
- ✅ Go/pivot/no-go decision made with evidence

## Common Workflows

### Workflow 1: New Product Idea
1. Use product-strategist for all 5 validation phases
2. If validation passes, use `mvp-builder` to build
3. Use `go-to-market-planner` to launch
4. Track product-market fit post-launch

### Workflow 2: Feature Prioritization
1. Use product-strategist Phase 5 (MVP Definition)
2. Apply must-have/should-have/nice-to-have framework
3. Build must-haves only
4. Validate before building should-haves

### Workflow 3: Pivot Decision
1. Use product-strategist Phase 1 to re-validate problem
2. If problem invalid, explore adjacent problems
3. Re-run all 5 phases for new direction
4. Compare economics to current approach

## Key Concepts

**5 Validation Phases:**
1. **Problem Validation**: Is the problem severe enough?
2. **Solution Validation**: Does your solution work?
3. **Market Validation**: Is the market large enough?
4. **Business Model Validation**: Are the economics viable?
5. **MVP Definition**: What's the minimum to test?

**The "Mom Test":**
Ask about past behavior, not future intentions:
- ✅ "Tell me about the last time you..."
- ❌ "Would you use this product?"

**Problem Severity Matrix:**
Score problems on frequency, impact, urgency, willingness to pay, and current workarounds. Need 4-5 "High" scores to build.

**Market Sizing:**
- **TAM**: Total addressable market (global)
- **SAM**: Serviceable addressable market (reachable)
- **SOM**: Serviceable obtainable market (realistic in 1-3 years)

**Unit Economics:**
- **LTV**: Customer Lifetime Value
- **CAC**: Customer Acquisition Cost
- **Ratio**: LTV:CAC must be ≥ 3:1

## Troubleshooting

**Skill not activating?**
- Try explicitly requesting: "Use the product-strategist skill to..."
- Mention keywords: "product validation", "product-market fit", "discovery"

**Problem validation failing?**
- You may be talking to friends/family (confirmation bias)
- Try recruiting strangers who actually have the problem
- Ask about past behavior, not future intentions

**Solution validation weak?**
- Test with prototype, not just description
- Watch users try to complete tasks
- Ask "Would you pay $X for this?" to test pricing

**Market too small?**
- Consider adjacent markets or use cases
- Expand geographic scope
- Target different customer segments
- May need to pivot

**LTV:CAC ratio poor?**
- Increase LTV: higher prices, longer retention, upsells
- Decrease CAC: organic channels, referrals, product-led growth
- May indicate market not ready or competition too strong

**MVP scope too large?**
- Re-apply must-have/should-have/nice-to-have filter
- Remove features that don't directly solve core problem
- Remember: MVP validates assumptions, not delights users
- Target 4-8 weeks, not 6+ months
