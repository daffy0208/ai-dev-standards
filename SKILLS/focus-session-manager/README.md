## Tips

### Trust the Breaks
Breaks feel like wasted time but they:
- ✅ Increase focus quality
- ✅ Prevent mistakes
- ✅ Improve creativity
- ✅ Sustain energy
- ✅ Protect health

**Math:** 10-min break = 30 min better focus

### Use Break Time Well
Good breaks:
- Walk outside (best)
- Stretch/move
- Get water/snack
- Look at distance (eyes)
- Social interaction

Bad breaks:
- More screen time
- Social media scrolling
- Work-related reading

### Ignore the Break Guilt
ADHD brains often feel:
- "I should keep working"
- "This is momentum loss"
- "Breaks are for weak people"

**Truth:** Breaks make you MORE productive, not less.

## Success Metrics

You're using this well when:
- ✅ Taking breaks regularly (not skipping)
- ✅ End-of-day energy higher
- ✅ Health checks completed
- ✅ No hyperfocus burnout
- ✅ Sustainable pace maintained

## Common Questions

**Q: Can I skip breaks?**
A: Can dismiss 2x, then system escalates to protect health.
