# Focus Session Manager

**Protect your health. Maximize focus. Prevent burnout.**

## Core Principle

ADHD brains are prone to hyperfocus (ignoring breaks, health) and time blindness (losing track of time). The solution: Automated session management that tracks time, enforces breaks, and protects health without disrupting flow state.

**Key Insight:** You can't manage time you can't see. Make time visible and automatic.

---

## The Focus Problem

### Problem 1: Hyperfocus Burnout
**Issue:** Code for 4 hours straight without break
**Result:** Exhaustion, health issues, reduced quality

### Problem 2: Time Blindness
**Issue:** "I'll work for 30 min" → Actually 3 hours
**Result:** Missed meetings, forgotten commitments, burnout

### Problem 3: Break Resistance
**Issue:** "Just one more thing" never stops
**Result:** No breaks, deteriorating health, reduced productivity

### Problem 4: Disrupted Flow
**Issue:** Harsh timer interruptions break concentration
**Result:** Frustration, ignoring timers, no break system

---

## Phase 1: Automatic Session Tracking

### Always-On Time Tracking

**Starts automatically when you begin coding:**

```markdown
[Session Started: 14:00]

⏱️ Focus Timer Running
📊 Today's focus time: 0 hours
🎯 Goal: 4 hours
🔥 Current streak: 2 days

Mode: Deep Work
Next break: 14:25 (in 25 min)
```

### Visible Time Display

**Status bar shows:**
```
⏱️ 23:45 | 🧠 Focus Session 1/4 | 💧 Water reminder soon
```

### Session Types (Auto-Detected)

**Deep Work:** Complex coding, architecture
- Duration: 45-90 minutes
- Break: 15 minutes
- Best for: New features, debugging

**Quick Tasks:** Bug fixes, updates
- Duration: 25 minutes
- Break: 5 minutes
- Best for: Small fixes, reviews

**Learning:** Reading docs, tutorials
- Duration: 30 minutes
- Break: 10 minutes
- Best for: New tech, research

## Phase 2: ADHD-Optimized Pomodoro

### Traditional Pomodoro (ADHD-Hostile)

❌ Rigid 25-min timer (might be mid-thought)
❌ Harsh interruption (breaks flow)
❌ Forced break (when you're in flow)
❌ No hyperfocus protection (ignores long sessions)

### ADHD-Friendly Pomodoro

✅ Flexible timers (25/45/90 min options)
✅ Gentle reminders (dismissable but persistent)
✅ Flow-aware breaks (suggests good stopping points)
✅ Hyperfocus detection (escalating alerts)

### Smart Break Timing

```markdown
[25 minutes elapsed]

🟡 Break suggestion available

Good stopping point detected:
- ✅ Just committed code
- ✅ Tests passing
- ✅ Natural pause point

Take 5-minute break?
[Take Break Now] [Extend 15 min] [Remind in 5 min]
```

---

## Phase 3: Break Management

### Break Types

**Micro-Break (2 minutes):**
- Look away from screen (20-20-20 rule)
- Stretch in chair
- No leaving desk

**Short Break (5 minutes):**
- Stand up
- Walk around
- Get water
- Bathroom

**Medium Break (15 minutes):**
- Walk outside
- Snack
- Different room
- Social interaction

**Long Break (30-60 minutes):**
- Meal
- Exercise
- Complete context switch

### Automatic Break Reminders

```markdown
[After 25 min coding]

⏸️ Break Suggestion (5 minutes)

Your brain has been focused for 25 min.
Short break will improve next session.

Break activities:
- [ ] Stand and stretch
- [ ] Get water
- [ ] Look out window (eyes)
- [ ] Bathroom if needed

Timer: 5 minutes
Resume automatically after break.

[Start Break] [Extend Session] [Dismiss]
```

### Break Enforcement Levels

**Level 1: Gentle Reminder (25-45 min)**
```
💭 Reminder: Break time soon
[Dismissable, comes back in 10 min]
```

**Level 2: Strong Suggestion (45-90 min)**
```
⚠️ You've been coding for 60 minutes
Break highly recommended
[Dismissable twice, then escalates]
```

**Level 3: Health Alert (90+ min)**
```
🚨 HEALTH ALERT: 90 min no break

This is affecting:
- Eye strain
- Back pain
- Mental fatigue
- Code quality

Required actions:
- [ ] Stand up NOW
- [ ] 2-minute walk
- [ ] Water

[Cannot dismiss until you move]
```

**Level 4: Forced Break (3+ hours)**
```
🛑 MANDATORY BREAK

You've been coding for 3 hours straight.
Context saved automatically.
Dev server paused.

Required 15-minute break.
I'll help you resume after.

[Break Started - Timer: 15:00]
```

---

## Phase 4: Hyperfocus Protection

### Hyperfocus Detection

**Triggers at 90 minutes continuous work:**

```markdown
[90 minutes elapsed]

🔍 HYPERFOCUS DETECTED

You've been deeply focused for 90 minutes.
This is good for productivity BUT...

Health check required:
- [ ] When did you last drink water? ____
- [ ] When did you last move? ____
- [ ] Are your eyes strained? Y/N
- [ ] Do you need bathroom? Y/N

If 2+ concerns: TAKE BREAK NOW
If 0-1 concerns: Can extend 30 min

[Take Break] [Extend 30min] [Health Check]
```

### The Hyperfocus Paradox

**Good Hyperfocus:** Deep work on right thing
**Bad Hyperfocus:** Stuck optimizing CSS for 4 hours

### Detecting Bad Hyperfocus

```markdown
[2 hours on same file, many reverts]

💭 Gentle check-in:

I notice you've been working on button.css
for 2 hours with 12 commits and 5 reverts.

Questions:
- Is this P0 for shipping? YES/NO
- Could this be "good enough" now? YES/NO
- Are you stuck in perfectionism? YES/NO

Maybe time to:
- Commit current state
- Move to next task
- Come back later with fresh eyes

[Keep Going] [Take Break] [Switch Tasks]
