# Deployment Advisor

Choose the right deployment strategy for your application scale and requirements.

## Core Principle

**Start simple, scale when needed.** Don't over-engineer infrastructure for 10 users that won't arrive for months.

## Deployment Tiers

### Tier 1: MVP / Small Projects (<1,000 users)

**Cost**: $0-$20/month
**Time to Deploy**: 5-15 minutes
**Best for**: MVPs, prototypes, side projects, marketing sites

**Recommended Platforms**:

**Vercel** (Next.js, React, static sites):
- Push to GitHub → auto deploy
- Edge functions, image optimization
- Free SSL, global CDN
- $0 for hobby, $20/mo for team

**Netlify** (Static sites, Jamstack):
- Similar to Vercel, better for non-Next.js
- Form handling, split testing
- Serverless functions

**Railway** (Full-stack, databases):
- Deploys anything (Node, Python, Go, Rust)
- Integrated PostgreSQL, Redis, MongoDB
- $5/mo for 512MB RAM + usage

**Cloudflare Pages** (Static + Workers):
- Free unlimited bandwidth
- Edge functions (Workers)
- Fastest CDN globally

---

### Tier 2: Growing Products (1K-100K users)

**Cost**: $20-$500/month
**Time to Deploy**: 1-4 hours
**Best for**: Validated products, growing startups, paid customers

**Recommended Platforms**:

**AWS Amplify** (Full-stack web apps):
- Managed hosting + backend
- Authentication, APIs, databases
- Auto-scaling, monitoring
- $50-200/mo typical

**Google Cloud Run** (Containerized apps):
- Pay only for actual usage
- Scales to zero
- Automatic HTTPS
- $20-100/mo for small traffic

**Fly.io** (Distributed apps):
- Global deployment (closer to users)
- PostgreSQL, Redis included
- Docker-based
- $50-200/mo

**Render** (Simpler alternative to AWS):
- Auto-deploy from Git
- PostgreSQL, Redis, cron jobs
- Free tier available
- $50-150/mo for production

---

### Tier 3: Scale / Enterprise (100K+ users)

**Cost**: $500-$5,000+/month
**Time to Deploy**: 1-4 weeks
**Best for**: High traffic, enterprise, compliance requirements

**Recommended Platforms**:

**AWS ECS** (Containers, no Kubernetes complexity):
- Fargate (serverless containers)
- Full AWS ecosystem
- Fine-grained control
- $500-2000/mo typical

**AWS EKS / Google GKE** (Kubernetes):
- Full orchestration
- Multi-region, auto-scaling
- Complex but powerful
- $1000-5000+/mo

**DigitalOcean App Platform** (Mid-tier simplicity):
- Kubernetes-powered, no K8s knowledge needed
- Cheaper than AWS
- Good middle ground
- $200-1000/mo

**Environment Variables**:
```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
API_KEY=secret_key

## Common Deployment Patterns

### Pattern 1: Jamstack (Static + API)

**Stack**: Next.js (Vercel) + API (Railway/Supabase)

**Pros**: Fast, cheap, scales easily
**Cons**: Not suitable for real-time or server-heavy apps

```
Frontend (Vercel) → API (Railway) → Database (Supabase)
```

### Pattern 2: Serverless

**Stack**: Vercel Functions + Serverless DB (Supabase/PlanetScale)

**Pros**: Zero server management, pay per use
**Cons**: Cold starts, vendor lock-in

```
Frontend (Vercel) → Edge Functions (Vercel) → Serverless DB
```

### Pattern 3: Traditional Full-Stack

**Stack**: Railway (Node.js + PostgreSQL)

**Pros**: Simple, everything in one place
**Cons**: Single point of failure

```
Railway: Node.js API + PostgreSQL + Redis
```

### Pattern 4: Microservices

**Stack**: Multiple Cloud Run services + Cloud SQL

**Pros**: Independent scaling, fault isolation
**Cons**: Complex, higher cost

```
Frontend (Vercel) → Service 1 (Cloud Run) → Database
                 → Service 2 (Cloud Run) → Queue
```

## Cost Optimization

### Free Tier Strategy
- Vercel: Free for personal projects
- Supabase: 500MB DB, 50K API requests/day
- Railway: $5 credit/month (enough for small API)
- Cloudflare: Unlimited bandwidth free

**Total**: $0-5/month for MVP

### Production Cost Optimization
- Use caching (Redis, CDN) to reduce compute
- Optimize images (Next.js Image, Cloudinary)
- Database connection pooling (PgBouncer)
- Monitor and right-size resources
- Use spot instances for non-critical workloads

---

## Security Best Practices

### Must-Haves
- ✅ HTTPS only (automatic on most platforms)
- ✅ Environment variables for secrets (never commit)
- ✅ Database encryption at rest
- ✅ Regular dependency updates
- ✅ Rate limiting on APIs

### Recommended
- Security headers (helmet.js for Node)
- DDoS protection (Cloudflare)
- Automated vulnerability scanning
- Audit logs for sensitive operations
- Backup and disaster recovery plan

---

## Monitoring & Observability

### Tier 1: Basic Monitoring
- Platform dashboards (Vercel Analytics, Railway Metrics)
- Error tracking: Sentry ($0-26/mo)
- Uptime monitoring: UptimeRobot (free), Better Uptime

### Tier 2: Enhanced Monitoring
- APM: New Relic, Datadog ($15-100/mo)
- Log aggregation: LogTail, Papertrail
- Custom metrics and alerting

### Tier 3: Enterprise Observability
- Full stack: Datadog, New Relic ($300-1000+/mo)
- Distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry)
- Custom dashboards (Grafana)
- PagerDuty for incidents
