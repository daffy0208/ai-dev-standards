# Go-to-Market Planner

Plan and execute successful product launches.

## Core Principle

**Launch is a campaign, not an event.** Build momentum before launch, peak at launch, sustain after launch.

## 5-Phase GTM Strategy

### Phase 1: Market Positioning

**Goal**: Define how product fits in market landscape

**Positioning Statement**:
```
For [target customer]
Who [customer need/problem]
[Product name] is a [product category]
That [key benefit/differentiation]
Unlike [competitors]
Our product [unique value]
```

**Competitive Analysis**:
| Competitor | Strengths | Weaknesses | Our Advantage |
|-----------|----------|-----------|---------------|
| Competitor A | Feature X | Price | Better UX |

**Validation**:
- [ ] Target customer clearly defined
- [ ] Differentiation identified
- [ ] Positioning tested with 5+ customers

### Phase 2: Messaging & Content

**Goal**: Create compelling launch messaging

**Message Hierarchy**:
1. **Headline**: Core benefit in 5-10 words
2. **Sub-headline**: How it works or who it's for (1 sentence)
3. **3 Key Benefits**: What users gain (feature → benefit)
4. **Social Proof**: Testimonials, case studies, logos
5. **Call-to-Action**: Clear next step

**Content Types**:
- Launch blog post
- Product demo video (2-3 min)
- Landing page
- Email announcement
- Social media posts (5-10 ready)
- Press release (if targeting media)

**Validation**:
- [ ] Messaging tested with target customers

- Offer exclusive early access
- Have assets ready (screenshots, quotes, data)

**Email Launch**:
- Segment: existing customers vs. waitlist vs. cold leads
- Subject line: Clear benefit, create urgency
- Body: Problem → Solution → CTA
- Send Tuesday-Thursday, 10 AM-2 PM for best open rates

**Community Launch**:
- Be authentic, not salesy
- Lead with value (solve a problem)
- Engage genuinely in comments
- Don't spam multiple communities same day

## Common GTM Mistakes

❌ **Launching without audience** → Build email list first
❌ **One-day launch, then silence** → Sustain momentum
❌ **No clear CTA** → Make next step obvious
❌ **Launching to everyone** → Target specific segment first
❌ **No success metrics** → Define goals before launch
❌ **Ignoring feedback** → Respond and iterate quickly
❌ **Over-promising** → Set realistic expectations
