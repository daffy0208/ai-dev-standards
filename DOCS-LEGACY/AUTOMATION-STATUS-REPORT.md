# Automation Status Report

**Date:** 2025-10-23
**Purpose:** Document current automation capabilities and gaps for skill/MCP activation and recommendations

---

## ‚úÖ What IS Automated

### 1. Skill Activation (Claude Triggers)

**Status:** ‚úÖ **EXCELLENT** - Fully automated

- **All 37 skills** have trigger keywords defined in `skill-registry.json`
- Claude automatically activates skills based on user intent
- Trigger system is context-aware and pattern-matching

**How it works:**
```
User says: "I need to build a RAG system"
‚Üí Claude detects: "rag", "retrieval augmented generation"
‚Üí Auto-activates: rag-implementer skill
‚Üí Uses: vector-database-mcp, embedding-generator-mcp
```

**Evidence:**
- `META/skill-registry.json`: All 37 skills have `triggers` array
- `.claude/claude.md`: 2 skills documented (dark-matter-analyzer, data-visualizer)

**Coverage:** 100% ‚úÖ

---

### 2. MCP Tool Discovery

**Status:** ‚úÖ **GOOD** - MCPs are discoverable

- All 7 MCPs registered in `META/registry.json`
- MCPs linked to enabling skills via `mcpServers[].enables` field
- Skills list required MCPs via `requires.mcps.existing` and `requires.mcps.planned`

**How it works:**
```
Skill activated: rag-implementer
‚Üí Registry shows: requires vector-database, embedding-generator
‚Üí Claude knows: These MCPs are available
‚Üí Can invoke: MCP tools automatically
```

**Coverage:** 7/7 MCPs fully integrated ‚úÖ

---

### 3. Registry Synchronization

**Status:** ‚úÖ **AUTOMATED** - Script created

- `scripts/fix-skill-registry.cjs` - Synchronizes skill-registry.json
- `scripts/update-registry.js` - Updates main registry.json (existing)
- Detects missing/extra skills automatically

**What it does:**
- Scans `SKILLS/` folder
- Compares with registry files
- Adds missing skills with extracted metadata
- Removes non-existent skills
- Updates version numbers

**Last run:** 2025-10-23 (fixed 15 missing skills, removed 2 non-existent)

---

### 4. Dark Matter Self-Check

**Status:** ‚úÖ **BUILT** - Meta-analysis capability

- `dark-matter-analyzer` skill monitors framework health
- `dark-matter-analyzer-mcp` provides automated checks
- Detects: registry drift, relationship gaps, automation failures

**Checks performed:**
- BUILD_FOCUS adherence
- Registry consistency (skill counts, MCP counts)
- Relationship integrity
- File update consistency
- Version synchronization

**Triggers:**
- On-demand (user request)
- Recommended: Weekly, after major changes, pre-release

---

## üü° What IS Partially Automated

### 5. Relationship Mapping

**Status:** üü° **PARTIAL** - Only 32% complete

- **Mapped:** 12/37 skills (32%)
- **Unmapped:** 25/37 skills (68%)

**What's mapped:**
- `skills_to_mcps`: 12 skills have MCP relationships
- `skills_to_components`: 7 skills have component dependencies
- `skills_to_integrations`: 5 skills have integration requirements
- `skills_to_standards`: 8 skills reference architecture patterns

**Missing relationships for:**
- 3d-visualizer
- animation-designer
- audio-producer
- brand-designer
- copywriter
- data-engineer
- data-visualizer
- design-system-architect
- focus-session-manager
- go-to-market-planner
- iot-developer
- knowledge-graph-builder
- livestream-engineer
- localization-engineer
- mobile-developer
- spatial-developer
- task-breakdown-specialist
- technical-writer
- testing-strategist
- user-researcher
- ux-designer
- video-producer
- visual-designer
- voice-interface-builder
- context-preserver

**Recommendation:** Create stub entries with `"planned": []` for all skills

---

## ‚ùå What IS NOT Automated

### 6. Gap Detection & Recommendations

**Status:** ‚ùå **MISSING** - No proactive recommendation system

**What's NOT happening:**
- Claude doesn't automatically suggest: "You need to build X skill for this project"
- No detection of: "This project would benefit from Y MCP"
- No analysis of: "Based on your project, here are missing capabilities"

**Example scenarios that aren't handled:**

**Scenario 1: User building RAG system without knowledge graph**
```
User: "Help me build a RAG system with complex entity relationships"
Current: Claude uses rag-implementer skill
Missing: Claude should recommend knowledge-graph-builder skill
```

**Scenario 2: User needs MCP that doesn't exist**
```
User: "I need to analyze my Lighthouse performance scores"
Current: performance-optimizer skill activates (manual analysis)
Missing: Claude should say "lighthouse-runner-mcp is planned but not built. Would you like me to recommend building it?"
```

**Scenario 3: Project lacks required integrations**
```
User: "Deploy my app to AWS Lambda"
Current: deployment-advisor skill activates
Missing: Claude should check if "platforms" integration exists and recommend installation
```

---

### 7. Automated File Updates After Changes

**Status:** ‚ùå **PARTIALLY MISSING** - Manual cascade required

**What needs automation:**

When a new skill is added, these 8+ files should auto-update:
1. `META/skill-registry.json` ‚úÖ (script exists)
2. `META/registry.json` ‚úÖ (script exists)
3. `META/relationship-mapping.json` ‚ùå (manual)
4. `README.md` ‚ùå (manual count update)
5. `BUILD_FOCUS.md` ‚ùå (manual count/ratio update)
6. `DOCS/INDEX.md` ‚ùå (manual count update)
7. `DOCS/MCP-DEVELOPMENT-ROADMAP.md` ‚ùå (manual count update)
8. `.claude/claude.md` ‚ùå (manual skill addition)

**Recommendation:** Create `scripts/add-skill.cjs [skill-name]` that cascades all updates

---

### 8. Pre-commit Validation Hooks

**Status:** ‚ùå **MISSING** - No git hooks

**What should happen:**
- Pre-commit: Validate registry counts match
- Pre-commit: Ensure skill has relationship stub
- Pre-commit: Check all 8 files updated if skill/MCP added
- Pre-push: Run dark-matter quick check

**Current state:** All validation is manual or post-facto

---

### 9. Proactive Skill/MCP Recommendations

**Status:** ‚ùå **COMPLETELY MISSING** - No intelligence layer

**What's needed:**

**A. Project Analysis Intelligence**
```javascript
// When user starts project, analyze:
- Tech stack (package.json)
- Project type (SaaS, RAG, multi-agent, etc.)
- Existing skills in .ai-dev.json
‚Üí Recommend: Missing skills that would help
```

**B. Gap Detection During Execution**
```javascript
// During conversation, detect:
- User struggling with performance
‚Üí Recommend: performance-optimizer skill
- User needs visual regression tests
‚Üí Recommend: screenshot-testing-mcp (already exists!)
- User needs API documentation
‚Üí Recommend: technical-writer skill + openapi-generator-mcp (planned)
```

**C. Build Recommendations**
```javascript
// When skill needs MCP that doesn't exist:
- Detect: mvp-builder needs feature-prioritizer-mcp
- Check: feature-prioritizer-mcp status = "planned"
- Inform: "This MCP is planned but not built yet"
- Suggest: "Would you like me to help build it based on the MCP specification template?"
```

## ü§ñ How Recommendations Should Work (Proposed)

### Example 1: User Building Performance-Heavy App

```
User: "I'm building a React dashboard with real-time updates"

Claude (internal logic):
1. Detects: "React" ‚Üí frontend-builder skill activates
2. Detects: "real-time" ‚Üí checks for real-time-systems pattern
3. Detects: "dashboard" ‚Üí checks for data-visualizer skill
4. Analyzes: High-performance requirements

Claude (to user):
"I'm activating the frontend-builder skill. Given your real-time dashboard
requirements, I recommend also using:
- performance-optimizer skill (for rendering optimization)
- data-visualizer skill (for efficient chart rendering)

I notice the performance-profiler-mcp is planned but not built. This would
help automatically detect bottlenecks. Would you like me to recommend
prioritizing its development?"
```

### Example 2: User Needs Missing MCP

```
User: "Run Lighthouse tests on my site"

Claude (internal logic):
1. Detects: "lighthouse" ‚Üí performance-optimizer skill activates
2. Checks: lighthouse-runner-mcp status = "planned" (not built)
3. Fallback: Can do manual analysis but not automated

Claude (to user):
"I can help you analyze Lighthouse results using the performance-optimizer
skill. However, I notice the lighthouse-runner-mcp is planned but not yet
built. This would enable:
- Automated Lighthouse CI runs
- Performance regression detection
- Automated reporting

Would you like me to:
1. Help you analyze performance manually now
2. Recommend building lighthouse-runner-mcp for your project
3. Show you the MCP specification so you can build it"
```

### Example 3: New Project Setup

```
User: "Bootstrap a new SaaS project"

Claude (internal logic):
1. Detects: "saas" ‚Üí uses create-saas installer
2. Analyzes installer manifest ‚Üí installs 5 skills, 2 MCPs
3. Checks for additional recommendations

Claude (to user):
"I'm setting up your SaaS project with:
- Skills: mvp-builder, product-strategist, frontend-builder, api-designer,
deployment-advisor
- MCPs: component-generator, accessibility-checker

Based on typical SaaS needs, you might also want:
- testing-strategist skill (for TDD workflow)
- security-engineer skill (for auth and data protection)
- screenshot-testing-mcp (for visual regression tests)

Would you like me to add these as well?"
```
