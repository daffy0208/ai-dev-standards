# Legacy Documentation Archive

> ⚠️ **HISTORICAL DOCUMENTS** - These files contain skill/MCP counts and status information
> from specific points in time. **DO NOT UPDATE** these counts - they are preserved
> exactly as they were to maintain historical accuracy.

This directory contains historical documentation that has been archived but preserved for reference.

## Purpose

Documents are moved here when they:
- Have been consolidated into newer, more comprehensive docs
- Represent completed phases or initiatives
- Contain historical context that may be useful for reference
- Are no longer part of the active documentation set

## Important: Counts and Status Are Historical

Many files in this directory reference specific counts (e.g., "36 skills", "3 MCPs", "12:1 ratio").
These numbers reflect the state of the repository **at the time the document was written** and
should NOT be updated to current values. They serve as a historical record of the repository's
evolution.

## Contents

### Dark Matter Documentation (Historical)
- `DARK_MATTER_ACTIONS_COMPLETE.md` - Status report of Dark Matter recommendations implementation
- `dark_matter_report.md` - Original Dark Matter Mode analysis (Oct 22, 2025)
- `Run Dark Matter Mode (Repository Application Spec v1.2).md` - Original runner instructions

**Current Version:** See `/DARK-MATTER-SPECIFICATION.md` in root directory

### Documentation Archive (from DOCS/archive)
Historical versions and iterations of various documentation files that have been superseded by consolidated versions.

## Usage

These documents are preserved for:
1. **Historical Reference** - Understanding how the project evolved
2. **Context Recovery** - Recovering decisions and rationale from earlier phases
3. **Pattern Recognition** - Identifying recurring themes across iterations
4. **Audit Trail** - Maintaining a record of significant documentation changes

## Important Notes

- **Do NOT use as current documentation** - Always refer to the active `/DOCS/` directory
- **Do NOT link to from active docs** - Legacy docs should not be referenced in current guides
- **Git history exists** - These files are also in git history, this is just for convenience

## Maintenance

This folder is periodically reviewed to:
- Ensure truly obsolete docs can be removed entirely
- Verify nothing here should actually be in active docs
- Update this README with new archived content
