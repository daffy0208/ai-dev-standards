- Categorizes skills automatically
- Sorts alphabetically

### Step 2: Ran the Script
```bash
node scripts/update-registry.js
```

**Result:**
```
✅ Registry updated!
   Before: 7 skills
   After: 36 skills
   Added: 29 skills

   ai: 2
   general: 2
   backend: 2
   devops: 1
   engineering: 1
```

### Step 3: Verified the Fix
```bash
# Count skills in registry
jq '.skills | length' META/registry.json
# Output: 36 ✅

# Verify specific skills
jq '.skills[] | select(.name == "product-strategist")' META/registry.json
# Output: Found! ✅
