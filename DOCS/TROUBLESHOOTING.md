# Troubleshooting Guide - ai-dev-standards

## Quick Start - Can't Get Commands to Work?

### Option 1: Use the Setup Script (Easiest)

```bash
cd /your/new/project

# Run setup from ai-dev-standards directory
bash ~/ai-dev-standards/setup-project.sh
```

**This will:**
1. Install the CLI if needed
2. Set up your project
3. Run automatic analysis
4. Give you recommendations on where to start

### Option 2: Install CLI First

```bash
cd ~/ai-dev-standards/CLI
npm install
npm link

# Now commands work
cd /your/project
ai-dev sync --yes
```

### Option 3: Direct npx (if published)

```bash
# This won't work yet (not published to npm)
npx @ai-dev-standards/bootstrap
```

---

## Common Issues

### 1. "Command not found: ai-dev"

**Problem:** CLI not installed

**Solution:**
```bash
cd ~/ai-dev-standards/CLI
npm install
npm link
```

### 2. "Not a project directory"

**Problem:** No package.json or .git

**Solution:**
```bash
# Either initialize git
git init

# Or initialize npm
npm init -y

# Then run setup
bash ~/ai-dev-standards/setup-project.sh
```

### 3. "Cannot find module"

**Problem:** Dependencies not installed

**Solution:**
```bash
cd ~/ai-dev-standards/CLI
npm install
```

### 4. Bootstrap script fails

**Problem:** Package not on npm yet

**Solution:** Use setup-project.sh instead:
```bash
bash ~/ai-dev-standards/setup-project.sh
```

## Setup for a GitHub Project

### New Project (just created)

```bash
# 1. Clone your repo
git clone git@github.com:yourusername/your-repo.git
cd your-repo

# 2. Run setup
bash ~/ai-dev-standards/setup-project.sh

# 3. Review the automatic analysis
# It will show:
# - Project health score
# - Recommended next steps
# - Which skills to use
# - Quick wins you can implement
```

### Existing Project

```bash
# 1. Navigate to your project
cd /path/to/your/project

# 2. Run setup (works on any project stage)
bash ~/ai-dev-standards/setup-project.sh

# 3. Review analysis and recommendations
```

## What the Setup Does

### Automatic Steps

1. ‚úÖ Checks if CLI is installed (installs if needed)
2. ‚úÖ Detects your project type (Next.js, React, Expo, etc.)
3. ‚úÖ Copies appropriate template
4. ‚úÖ Updates paths to absolute paths
5. ‚úÖ Runs initial sync (installs all 103 resources)
6. ‚úÖ **NEW:** Analyzes your repository
7. ‚úÖ **NEW:** Provides customized recommendations

### What You Get

After setup completes, you'll see:

```
üîç AI Dev Standards - Project Analysis

‚úì Git repository detected
‚úì package.json found
‚úì Languages detected: TypeScript JavaScript

üìä Project Statistics
Total files: 50
Code files: 35

üéØ Analysis & Recommendations

‚ö° Quick Wins (Do These First):
  1. Create README.md with project description
  2. Add .gitignore file
  3. Create .env.example for environment variables

‚úÖ Analysis Complete
```

## Understanding the Analysis

### Project Health Score (0-100)

- **80-100:** Excellent - Well-structured project
- **60-79:** Good - Solid foundation, room for improvement
- **40-59:** Fair - Basic setup, needs enhancements
- **0-39:** Needs Work - Missing critical components

### Project Stages

- **empty:** No code yet, starting from scratch
- **early:** Less than 10 code files, just getting started
- **growing:** 10-50 files, actively developing
- **established:** 50+ files, mature codebase

### Recommendations

The analysis provides:
1. **Priority tasks** - What to focus on now
2. **Recommended skills** - Which ai-dev skills to use
3. **Quick wins** - Easy improvements you can make today
4. **Framework-specific** - Tailored to your tech stack

---

## Using the Analysis

### Example: New Next.js Project

```bash
# After seeing the analysis, ask Claude:
"I have a new Next.js project at the early stage.
The analysis recommended using frontend-builder and testing-strategist.
Help me set up the project structure and add tests."
```

Claude will:
- Reference the appropriate skills
- Use the recommended approaches
- Help you implement the priority tasks

### Example: Growing React App

```bash
# After analysis shows need for tests:
"The analysis shows I need test coverage.
Use the testing-strategist skill to help me add tests
for my React components."
```

---

## Manual Analysis (Without Setup)

You can run analysis on any project without setting up ai-dev:

```bash
bash ~/ai-dev-standards/scripts/analyze-project.sh /path/to/your/project
```

This will:
- Analyze the project
- Show recommendations
- NOT install anything

---

## Getting Help

### Check Installation

```bash
# Verify CLI is installed
ai-dev --version

# Check what's been synced
cat .ai-dev.json

# See what skills are available
cat .claude/claude.md
```

### Re-run Analysis

```bash
bash ~/ai-dev-standards/scripts/analyze-project.sh .
```

### Re-sync Resources

```bash
ai-dev sync --yes
```

### Force Re-install

```bash
# Remove config
rm .ai-dev.json
rm -rf .claude/

# Run setup again
bash ~/ai-dev-standards/setup-project.sh
```

---

## Common Workflows

### 1. Brand New Project

```bash
mkdir my-new-app
cd my-new-app
git init
bash ~/ai-dev-standards/setup-project.sh

# Analysis will show "empty" stage
# Recommended: mvp-builder, product-strategist
```

### 2. Existing Project (First Time)

```bash
cd ~/my-existing-app
bash ~/ai-dev-standards/setup-project.sh

# Analysis will detect project stage
# Give customized recommendations
```

### 3. Update Existing Integration

```bash
cd ~/my-project-with-ai-dev
ai-dev sync --yes

# Re-run analysis to get updated recommendations
bash ~/ai-dev-standards/scripts/analyze-project.sh .
```

---

## Advanced Options

### Skip Analysis

```bash
# Set environment variable
SKIP_ANALYSIS=true bash ~/ai-dev-standards/setup-project.sh
```

### Analysis Only

```bash
# Don't install anything, just analyze
bash ~/ai-dev-standards/scripts/analyze-project.sh .
```

### Custom Template

```bash
# Before running setup, copy your preferred template
cp ~/ai-dev-standards/TEMPLATES/cursorrules-ai-rag.md .cursorrules

# Then run setup (will skip template copy)
bash ~/ai-dev-standards/setup-project.sh
```

---

## Questions?

### "The analysis says I need tests but I don't know where to start"

Ask Claude:
```
"Use the testing-strategist skill to help me set up tests.
My project is a [Next.js/React/Python] app."
```

### "I got recommendations but I'm overwhelmed"

Focus on Quick Wins first! They're small, easy tasks that give immediate value.

### "The analysis detected the wrong project type"

The setup script auto-detects, but you can manually:
1. Copy a different template from `TEMPLATES/`
2. Edit `.cursorrules` to reflect your stack
3. Ask Claude for guidance using specific skills
