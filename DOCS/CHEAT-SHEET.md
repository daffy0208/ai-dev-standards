## Common Conversations

### Feature Prioritization

**Scenario:** User requested a feature, decide if you should build it

```
You: "A user wants Gantt chart view. Should we build it?"

Expected Claude Response (using mvp-builder):
- Asks: How many users requested this? (Need 5-10 to validate)
- Classifies as P0/P1/P2 based on roadmap
- Estimates effort vs value
- Recommends: Build / Validate first / Decline

Follow-up:
"Use the mvp-builder skill to prioritize our feature backlog"
```

---

### Architecture Decisions

**Scenario:** Choosing between technical approaches

```
You: "Should I use RAG or fine-tuning for our 1000-doc knowledge base?"

Expected Claude Response (using DECISION-FRAMEWORK + rag-pattern):
- Compares RAG vs fine-tuning
- Considers: data size, update frequency, cost, citations needed
- Recommends based on your specific requirements
- Explains trade-offs clearly

Alternatives:
"Should I use PostgreSQL or MongoDB?"
"Should I use REST or GraphQL?"
"Should I use Redux or Zustand?"
```

---

### Adding New Features

**Scenario:** Build a new feature following existing patterns

```
You: "Add a feature to archive tasks. Match our existing code style."

Expected Claude Response:
1. Reads similar existing code (e.g., delete tasks feature)
2. Follows same pattern (UI ‚Üí API ‚Üí Database)
3. Matches naming conventions
4. Includes tests
5. Uses existing utilities

Verify:
- Component named correctly (TaskArchiveButton.tsx)
- API route follows pattern (/api/tasks/[id]/archive.ts)
- Uses existing auth/validation utilities
```

---

### Performance Optimization

**Scenario:** Something is slow, need to fix it

```
You: "Our search takes 5 seconds for 10k records. Fix this."

Expected Claude Response (using performance-optimizer):
1. Profiles current implementation
2. Identifies bottleneck (e.g., missing database index)
3. Proposes solutions ranked by effort/impact
4. Recommends incremental approach
5. Provides implementation

Follow-up:
"Optimize the dashboard page load time"
"Why is this API endpoint slow?"
"Reduce the bundle size of our app"
```

---

### Adding AI Features

**Scenario:** Add RAG-powered search to existing app

```
You: "Add AI search to our 5k documentation pages, need <2s response"

Expected Claude Response (using rag-implementer + rag-pattern):
1. Chooses architecture (Advanced RAG for 5k docs)
2. Selects components (Pinecone, OpenAI, re-ranker)
3. Designs pipeline (query ‚Üí retrieval ‚Üí LLM)
4. Integrates with existing code patterns
5. Provides cost estimates

Alternatives:
"Add AI-powered task suggestions"
"Add chatbot to answer customer questions"
"Add semantic search to our product catalog"
```

---

### Bug Fixes

**Scenario:** Fix a bug in existing code

```
You: "Tasks not showing for new users - investigate and fix"

Expected Claude Response:
1. Reads relevant code to understand flow
2. Identifies root cause
3. Proposes minimal fix (don't refactor everything)
4. Adds regression test
5. Documents why bug occurred

Verify:
- Fix is minimal (doesn't refactor unrelated code)
- Preserves existing behavior
- Includes test to prevent regression
```

---

### Code Review

**Scenario:** Review a PR before merging

```
You: "Review this PR: [describe changes]"

Expected Claude Response:
1. Checks against ai-dev-standards best practices
2. Verifies security (auth, validation, injection prevention)
3. Checks performance (N+1 queries, bundle size)
4. Ensures tests included
5. Verifies matches existing code style

Provides:
- ‚úÖ What's good
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs attention
- ‚ùå Must fix before merge
- üí° Suggestions for future
```

---

### Refactoring

**Scenario:** Improve existing code

```
You: "Refactor this module for better performance"

Expected Claude Response (using performance-optimizer):
1. Measures current performance (baseline)
2. Identifies optimization opportunities
3. Refactors incrementally (not big bang)
4. Measures after (shows improvement)
5. Ensures tests still pass

Verify:
- Backwards compatible (same behavior)
- Measured improvement (not premature optimization)
- Tests updated and passing
```

---

### Documentation

**Scenario:** Document existing code

```
You: "Document all functions in /lib/db.ts using JSDoc"

Expected Claude Response:
- Reads each function
- Adds JSDoc comments with params, returns, examples
- Documents edge cases
- Explains business logic

Follow-up:
"Create a README for the /components directory"
"Explain what this component does"
"Document our API endpoints in OpenAPI format"
```

---

### Deployment Decisions

**Scenario:** Choose where to host your app

```
You: "Where should I deploy my Next.js app? Budget: $50/month, expect 10k users"

1. Considers your stack, budget, scale
2. Recommends platform (e.g., Vercel + Railway)
3. Explains 3-tier pricing strategy
4. Provides upgrade path
5. Estimates actual costs

Alternatives:
"Should I use AWS or Vercel?"
"How do I scale from 1k to 100k users?"
"What's the cheapest way to deploy?"
```

---

### Go-to-Market Planning

**Scenario:** Planning a product launch

```
You: "I'm launching in 4 weeks. Help me plan the launch."

Expected Claude Response (using go-to-market-planner):
1. Uses 6-week launch timeline
2. Covers: positioning, messaging, channels, metrics
3. Suggests Product Hunt, email, social strategy
4. Provides checklist with deadlines
5. Defines success criteria

---

## Troubleshooting

### Claude Not Loading Standards

**Problem:** Claude doesn't seem to know about ai-dev-standards

**Fix:**
```markdown
# In .cursorrules, use absolute path:
Repository: ~/ai-dev-standards/

# NOT:
Repository: ./ai-dev-standards/  ‚ùå
Repository: ai-dev-standards/    ‚ùå
```

---

### Skills Not Activating

**Problem:** Claude doesn't use skills automatically

**Fix:** Be explicit:
```
"Use the [skill-name] skill to..."
"Reference rag-pattern.md for this"
"Check DECISION-FRAMEWORK.md for guidance"
```

---

### Claude Refactors Everything

**Problem:** Asked to add feature, Claude refactors entire codebase

**Fix:** Add to .cursorrules:
```markdown
## Instructions for Claude

**NEVER refactor existing code unless explicitly asked.**

When adding features:
- Match existing patterns exactly
- Don't "improve" working code
- Focus on the requested feature only
```

---

### Claude Ignores Existing Patterns

**Problem:** New code doesn't match existing style

**Fix:** Show examples in .cursorrules:
```markdown
## Code Conventions (CRITICAL: MATCH THESE)

### ‚úÖ DO THIS (our pattern):
[paste actual example from your code]

### ‚ùå DON'T DO THIS:
[show what to avoid]
```

---
