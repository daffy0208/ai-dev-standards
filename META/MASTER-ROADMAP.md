## Implementation Strategy

### Parallel Workstreams

**Stream 1: Skills (4-6 hours each)**
- Focus: One skill per day
- Output: SKILL.md + README.md per skill

**Stream 2: Patterns (4-6 hours each)**
- Focus: One pattern every 2-3 days
- Output: Comprehensive architecture pattern

**Stream 3: MCPs (1-2 weeks each)**
- Focus: One MCP per sprint
- Output: Working MCP server + documentation

**Stream 4: Best Practices (2-4 hours each)**
- Focus: Quick wins between skills
- Output: Checklists and standards

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Too Much Content
**Mitigation:** Keep skills focused (150-300 lines), reference patterns for depth

### Risk 2: Skills Become Outdated
**Mitigation:** Version all content, quarterly review cycle

### Risk 3: Low Adoption
**Mitigation:** Test with real projects after each phase, gather feedback

### Risk 4: Burnout / Timeline Slip
**Mitigation:** Build P0 first, P1/P2 can be deprioritized if needed

---

## Quick Wins (Build Anytime)

Low-effort, high-impact items:
1. code-review-checklist.md (1 day)
2. deployment-checklist.md (1 day)
3. error-handling-patterns.md (2 days)
4. api-design-principles.md (2 days)
