## Priority Matrix (P0/P1/P2)

### P0 - Critical Gaps (Build First)

These are foundational skills/patterns that most developers need regularly:

#### 1. **security-engineer** Skill 🔴
**Why Critical:**
- Security is non-negotiable for production apps
- Every project needs auth, validation, encryption
- Common vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, CSRF) not covered

**What It Should Cover:**
- Auth patterns (JWT, OAuth, session-based)
- Input validation and sanitization
- OWASP Top 10 prevention
- Secret management
- Security headers and CORS
- Rate limiting and DDoS protection
- Audit logging

**Use Cases:**
- "How do I secure this API endpoint?"
- "Is this authentication flow secure?"

**Estimated Value:** 10/10 (affects every project)

---

#### 2. **testing-strategist** Skill 🔴
**Why Critical:**
- Testing is missing from all current skills

- ❓ "How do you currently handle authentication and authorization?"

### For Testing Skill:
- ❓ "What percentage of your code has tests?"
- ❓ "How confident are you when deploying to production?"
- ❓ "Tell me about the last bug that tests would have caught"

### For Database Patterns:
- ❓ "How do you currently design database schemas?"
- ❓ "Have you ever had performance issues with database queries?"
- ❓ "How do you handle database migrations?"

3. "What patterns would save you the most time?"
4. "What's missing from this list?"

---

## Conclusion

**Immediate Priority (Next 30 days):**
1. Create security-engineer skill
2. Create testing-strategist skill
3. Create database patterns

**Rationale:**
- Security is non-negotiable (P0)
- Testing affects quality (P0)
- Database affects every backend (P0)

**Success Metrics:**
- 80% of projects use security-engineer skill
- Bug rate decreases 40% with testing-strategist
- Database query performance improves 50%

**Next Review:** After P0 items complete, reassess P1 priorities based on usage data.

## Appendix: Competitor Analysis

What other AI dev standards/frameworks include that we don't:

**Cursor Rules Collections:**
- Security patterns ✅ (we need)
- Testing templates ✅ (we need)
- Docker/containerization ⚠️ (covered in deployment-advisor)
- Git workflows ⚠️ (could add playbook)

**Claude Artifacts:**
- Component libraries ⚠️ (could add)
- Pre-built templates ⚠️ (have some)

**LangChain Docs:**
- More agent patterns ⚠️ (could expand multi-agent)
- Retrieval strategies ✅ (have in RAG)

**Verdict:** We're missing security, testing, and database patterns most critically.
