---

## Resource Requirements

### Time Commitment
- **Weeks 1-4 (Security + Testing):** 4 weeks @ 40 hours/week = 160 hours
- **Weeks 5-8 (Database + Observability):** 4 weeks @ 40 hours/week = 160 hours
- **Weeks 9-12 (Advanced Patterns):** 4 weeks @ 20 hours/week = 80 hours

**Total Phase 1-5:** 400 hours (~10 weeks full-time)

### Validation Approach
- After each phase, test with 3-5 real projects
- Collect feedback via survey
- Iterate based on usage patterns

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Skills Too Generic
**Mitigation:** Include framework-specific examples (Next.js, Django, etc.)

### Risk 2: Too Much Content
**Mitigation:** Keep skills focused (150-300 lines), detailed patterns separate

### Risk 3: Outdated Quickly
**Mitigation:** Version all content, plan quarterly reviews

---

## Decision Points

### After Phase 1 (Week 2)
**Question:** Is security-engineer skill being used?
- **If yes:** Continue to Phase 2
- **If no:** Iterate on content, add more examples

### After Phase 2 (Week 4)
**Question:** Are testing patterns improving code quality?
- **If yes:** Continue to Phase 3
- **If no:** Add more framework-specific guidance

### After Phase 4 (Week 8)
**Question:** Should we prioritize data-engineer or mobile-developer next?
- **Decision criteria:** User demand, project types using ai-dev-standards

---

## Quick Wins (Can Do in Parallel)

While building main phases, also create:

**Week 1-2:**
- code-review-checklist.md (1 day)
- deployment-checklist.md (1 day)
- error-handling-patterns.md (2 days)

**Week 3-4:**
- api-design-principles.md (2 days)
- git-workflow-playbook.md (1 day)

These are low effort but provide immediate value.

---

## What NOT to Build (Yet)

**Defer to Phase 7+ (Month 6+):**
- blockchain-builder skill (niche, low demand)
- game-developer skill (very specialized)
- ML training skill (separate from RAG/inference)

**Why Defer:**
- Limited use cases
- High effort
- Can revisit if user demand emerges

---

## Validation Checklist

Before building each deliverable:

- [ ] Is this a common pain point? (Ask 5+ users)
- [ ] Will this be used weekly? (Not just once)
- [ ] Does it complement existing skills? (Not duplicate)
- [ ] Can we provide concrete examples? (Not just theory)
- [ ] Is timing right? (P0 before P1 before P2)

---

## Next Steps

1. **This Week:** Start security-engineer skill
2. **Get Feedback:** Share draft with 3-5 developers
3. **Iterate:** Based on feedback, finalize
4. **Launch:** Add to skill-registry.json as "active"
5. **Measure:** Track usage over 2 weeks
6. **Repeat:** Move to testing-strategist

---

## Appendix: Community Feedback

Will add here after surveying users:

**Questions to Ask:**
1. "Which gap affects your work most?"
2. "What would you use every week?"
3. "What's still missing from this roadmap?"

**Survey After Phase 1:** [Results TBD]
**Survey After Phase 2:** [Results TBD]
